# Python-BlackJackCapstone
My First Basic Python Mini project of BlackJackCapstone
# 🃏 Blackjack Game

A simple **Blackjack game** built in Python! This project was inspired by Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Python course, and it helps reinforce concepts like functions, loops, and handling game logic.

## 📂 Features
- Deal random cards from a standard deck (Ace as 1 or 11)  
- Calculate player and computer scores automatically  
- Check for a **Blackjack** or **bust**  
- Let the player decide whether to draw another card or pass  
- The computer plays until its score is at least 17

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install Python (if not already installed)  
2. Clone the repository or save the code as `blackjack.py`  
3. Open a terminal and run:
```bash
python blackjack.py
```

## 🏁 Game Rules
- **Blackjack:** Score of 21 with the first two cards  
- **Player bust:** Score goes over 21  
- **Computer rules:** Draws cards until the score reaches 17 or higher  

## 🎯 Future Improvements
- Add a **betting system**  
- Track **player vs computer wins** across multiple rounds  
- Use **Unicode card symbols** for a more visual experience
